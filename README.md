Project Description:

Background:
As AI systems increasingly integrate into various sectors, the risk of AI-related incidents grows. These incidents can have significant impacts on different stakeholders, making it critical to predict who might be affected. Traditional approaches have focused on documenting past incidents, but there is a need for a forward-looking, predictive approach that leverages modern machine learning techniques to enhance safety and ethical AI deployment.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies stakeholders who are likely to be impacted when AI-related incidents happen. By analyzing incident reports using natural language processing and machine learning, this model aims to provide actionable insights that can help mitigate risks and inform responsible AI design.

Research Objectives:

Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Utilize the OECD AI incident database to analyze and clean incident data for machine learning applications.
Feature Engineering: Apply natural language processing techniques to extract and engineer relevant features from incident reports.
Model Development: Implement various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), to predict affected stakeholders.
Model Evaluation: Compare and evaluate the models based on metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall to determine the best-performing approach.
Custom Model Implementation: Develop a custom taxonomy model that combines the strengths of the best-performing models to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce computational costs.
